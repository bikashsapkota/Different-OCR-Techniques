<b>Model:</b> model.ser (which is available inside compressed file) <br>
<b>Confusion Matrix:</b> Can be generated from program <br>
<b>Preprocess:</b> Since data was available with binarized 28*28 image, no preprocess method was implemented<br>
<b>Library Used:</b> Weka (which is inside lib folder)<br>
<b>Algorithm Used:</b> John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm for training support vector classifier <br>
<b>Deployment Steps:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>Include weka library in the project</li>
		<li>Run Main.java and you can see different options</li>
	</ol>
Since Model is already provided you donâ€™t have to train the model for prediction and generating confusion matrix.
