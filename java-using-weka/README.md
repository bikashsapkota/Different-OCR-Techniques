<b>Model:</b> model.ser (which is available inside compressed file)
Confusion Matrix: Can be generated from program

<b>Preprocess:</b> Since data was available with binarized 28*28 image, no preprocess method was implemented
<b>Library Used:</b> Weka (which is inside lib folder)
<b>Algorithm Used:</b> John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm for training support vector classifier
<b>Deployment Steps:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>Include weka library in the project</li>
		<li>Run Main.java and you can see different options</li>
	</ol>
Since Model is already provided you don’t have to train the model for prediction and generating confusion matrix.
