<b>Model:</b> model.ser (which is available inside compressed file)
Confusion Matrix: Can be generated from program

<b>Preprocess:</b> Since data was available with binarized 28*28 image, no preprocess method was implemented
<b>Library Used:</b> Weka (which is inside lib folder)
<b>Algorithm Used:</b> John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm for training support vector classifier

Deployment Steps: 

Include weka library in the project

Run Main.java and you can see different options


Since Model is already provided you don’t have to train the model for prediction and generating confusion matrix.
